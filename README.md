# 📜 get_next_line
Welcome to get_next_line, a project that takes file reading to the next level—literally, one line at a time! 🚀

This function allows you to read a file (or standard input) line by line, making it perfect for handling dynamic inputs or processing large files without loading everything into memory. 🧵✨

## 🛠️ Features
<li>Handles multiple file descriptors: Read from different files simultaneously! 📂
<li>Efficient reading: No need to worry about memory bloat; it keeps things light and efficient. 💡
<li>Works with any buffer size: Flexible and adaptable for your needs. 🛠️

## 💻 Prototype
```
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

<li>fd: File descriptor to read from.
<li>Returns:
<ul>
<li>A pointer to the next line read (including the newline, if present).
<li>NULL if there’s nothing more to read or an error occurs.
</ul>

## 🧠 What I Learned
<li>Static Variables: Using static storage to persist data between function calls. 🧠
<li>Memory Management: Allocating and freeing memory dynamically with precision. 🧼
<li>Edge Case Handling: EOF, empty lines, and crazy buffer sizes? Bring it on! 💪

## 🤔 Why get_next_line?
Ever needed to read a file line by line, but found fgets limiting? get_next_line is here to save the day! 🎉 Whether it's parsing logs, handling configs, or reading user inputs, this function is a must-have in any C programmer's toolbox. 🛠️
